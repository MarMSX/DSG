1- Compiling and running

Once this program was coded in Java, it is compatible with many O.S. such Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
It is not necessary to recompile the Java executables to run in a specific operating system. The Java binaries are the same for any O.S.

1.1. Compiling
* Simple type on a command line:
javac Main.java

1.2. Creating the package:
* Copy all the ".class" files to an empty directory.
* Then, copy the "img" and "META-INF" (available on binaries package) directories to that directory.
* Compact all the directory content using the ZIP format.
* Change the compressed file extension to ".jar".

1.3. Running the ".jar" file
* Type on the command line:
java -jar dsg.jar
